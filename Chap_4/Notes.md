# Naming Matters
* Naming conventions: The casing of the letters and how the consecutive words are separated
* For classes use the `PascalCase` naming convention
  * PEP 8 recommends you capitalize all Acronymns in a PascalCase name
* Use snake_case for: variables,functions,methods and arguments
* Use CAPS_LOCK_WITH_UNDERSCORES: for global constants
* Below are some widely acceptsd names but not by-force: `self,cls`
* On-char names should be avoided
