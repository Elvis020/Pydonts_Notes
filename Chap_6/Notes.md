# Assignment expressions and the walrus operator(:=)
* The walrus operator, := was introduced in Python 3.8
* The walrus is used in assignment expressions
* The walrus operator should be discouraged if it makes the code looks convoluted
* But with the walrus operator, your code can be made
  * faster
  * readable and expressive
  * shorter
* Use-cases of walrus operators
  * Controlling a while loop initialisation
  * Reducing visual noise
  * Reuse computation in list comprehensions
  * Flattening related logic
* Assignment expressions allow the binding of a name to a part of an expression
