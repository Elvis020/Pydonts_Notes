# Zip up
* An iterator is something that can be traversed linearly
* zip is lazy and will only compute when you ask for it
* From python 3.10, zip has an argument(strict) that tells zip to error if the lengths are not the same. This helps catch bugs in the code
* zip makes your code shorter and concise
* Python has a library for dealing with fileWsystem paths, known as _Pathlib_
* The pathlib module uses zip in its implementation in finding the path of files
* DIctReader and DictWriter are useful when you want to use the header of the CSV file to read the rows like a dictionary
